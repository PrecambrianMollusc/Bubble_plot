Game Elite Dangerous 
This is a initial rendering of the bubble with expansion from the colonisation game expansion 

It is a simple html file rendered from other code in python that uses pyvista to render the systems with allegiance
Work in progress to export from the pyvsita code rendering to a gtlf file as meshes. The js code here will then add visualisation (colours etc) and layer switches to that to enable users to interact with the visualisations
